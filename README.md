# CodsoftJuly_To-do-list

# Code Explaination

"To-Do List" application implemented using the Tkinter library in Python. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can add tasks to the To-Do list, delete tasks, and view the list of tasks.

The todo class: This is the main class responsible for setting up the GUI and handling user interactions.

**GUI Elements:**

* Label: The application displays a title label at the top, indicating "To-Do-List."
  
* Label2 and Label3: Two labels are provided, one for "Add items" and another for "Tasks," to indicate the input and output sections respectively.

* Listbox: This is used to display the list of tasks. Users can view and scroll through the list if there are more tasks than can be displayed in the available space.
  
* Scrollbar: A vertical scrollbar is attached to the Listbox to facilitate scrolling when the list of tasks exceeds the visible area.

* Text and Entry: These are used to input tasks that the user wants to add to the To-Do list.
  
* Button: There are two buttons provided - "ADD" and "DELETE" - which allow the user to add tasks and delete selected tasks from the list.

* Adding Tasks (add method): When the user enters a task in the Text widget and clicks the "ADD" button, the add method is called. It retrieves the task text, inserts it into the Listbox, and writes it to a file named "data.txt" for persistence.

* Deleting Tasks (delete method): When the user selects a task in the Listbox and clicks the "DELETE" button, the delete method is called. It removes the selected task from the Listbox and updates the "data.txt" file accordingly.

**main function:** This function initializes the Tkinter application, creates an instance of the todo class, and starts the main event loop to handle user interactions and display the GUI.

**process of using the application**

To add tasks to the To-Do List, you simply need to type the task description in the designated "Add items" input box. Once you enter the task, click the "ADD" button, and it will be appended to the list instantly. All your tasks will appear in the "Tasks" section, and you can scroll through the list to view all of them.

If you want to remove a completed or unnecessary task, you can select it from the displayed list by clicking on it. After selecting the task, click the "DELETE" button to remove it from the list.

The application will automatically save your tasks to a file named "data.txt," ensuring that your tasks are retained even if you close or restart the application.

The GUI layout is designed to be clean and intuitive, providing a clear separation between the input and output sections. The title, "To-Do-List," is prominently displayed, giving you a clear indication of the application's purpose. The vertical scrollbar enables you to efficiently navigate through your tasks, even when the list becomes extensive.

Overall, this To-Do List application offers you a user-friendly and efficient means of managing your tasks, providing a seamless experience for organizing and updating your daily tasks.
